## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 1500 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## User requirements
* R1. Platform
    * R1.1. The extension that we will make will be for Mobile
* R2. The function is to show the rehearsal and concert calendar to the end users. It is open to new extensions in the future.
* R3. Users will need to have an email address and password to enter the application.
* R4. The app will have a main menu where you can access to see the projects, calendar (with the "rehearsal" and "concert" events), conductors, soloists and works.
    * R4.1 Only the information will be visible, users will not be able to modify anything and will not be able to merge anything.

## Usability

## Floating button 

![screenshots](https://github.com/pablopuch/OFGC/blob/master/screenshots/boton.png)

Using the floating button is more manageable when creating as you can do it with just one hand. Nowadays mobiles are getting bigger and bigger and having a button at thumb height improves the fluidity of the app. 


## Tab icons

![screenshots](https://github.com/pablopuch/OFGC/blob/master/screenshots/icon.png)

Con la ayuda visual de los iconos, nos dan una idea de que es lo que vamos a visualizar en la pagina siguiente.


## Drop-down menu

![screenshots](https://github.com/pablopuch/OFGC/blob/master/screenshots/menu-2.png)
![screenshots](https://github.com/pablopuch/OFGC/blob/master/screenshots/menu-3.png)

The menu is hidden in order to make it easier for the user to view and have a better experience. However, if we want to show the menu we have two options, either click on the three horizontal stripes in the top corner or slide your finger across the screen to the right and it will be displayed.

## Error messages

![screenshots](https://github.com/pablopuch/OFGC/blob/master/screenshots/formulario.png)

When creating or modifying an event, we get error messages indicating which elements of the form are wrong or missing.

## Advantages and disadvantages of each technology

![screenshots](https://github.com/pablopuch/OFGC/blob/master/screenshots/nativa.png)

### Native App
Native Apps are those applications that are developed for a specific device or platform. In other words, they work on the device without the need for any external programme as they have been developed in the specific programming language of each device. The term Native App is usually associated with mobile devices and therefore there are Native Apps for each operating system such as iOS or Android.

### Web App
These are applications developed with Web technologies that can be used by accessing a Web server via the Internet (or Intranet) through a browser. It is precisely the fact that they are accessed from a web browser that gives web apps most of their advantages (and disadvantages).

Among the advantages of web apps are the simplicity of development and their lower cost. In this case, a single web app is developed and distributed to all users through the use of the browser, either from a mobile device or from a desktop device. In this way, using responsive design, a web application can be made to adapt to any type of device.

The main drawback of web apps is that it offers a more limited user experience as it cannot, at least in a simple and direct way, access all device-specific features, such as graphic performance, GPS, camera, accelerometer, altimeter, contacts, etc. It may also offer a somewhat lower level of security as it depends on the security of the browser itself.

### Hybrid App
Hybrid applications are a mixture of the two previous ones. They take advantage of the versatility of developing a web application with HTML5, CSS and Javascript, allowing the use of some of the hardware functions available in native applications that could not be used in web apps. To do this, the app developed, instead of being displayed in a web browser, as in the case of web apps, is displayed in a WebView, which is a browser integrated in a native application and can therefore use these specific hardware resources by means of plugins.

The main advantage of Hybrid Apps, apart from the possibility of using hardware resources directly, is that they are independent of the operating system (iOS and Android). This makes it possible to reduce the initial investment in the project in the medium term compared to native Apps, as it does not require maintaining several different versions depending on the operating system.

On the other hand, the main disadvantage compared to native apps is that the user experience is not as good as in native apps and the performance and loading speed is much slower than a native app.

### PWA
Progressive web apps are somewhere in between: they are basically web pages, but through the use of Service Workers and other technologies they behave more like normal apps than web apps.

Using Service Workers and other technologies, progressive web apps can continue to run in the background without having to live inside the browser. On mobile it is possible to install them as an app and also on Windows through the mediation of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Windows 10 will add support for Progressive Web Apps in the Microsoft Store in the next major update, codenamed Redstone 4.

In short, progressive web apps are a natural evolution of web apps that blur the barrier between the web and apps, being able to perform tasks that usually only native apps could do. Examples include notifications, offline operation, or the ability to try a lighter version before downloading a real native app.

### Ionic 5 and Hybrid Apps

It powers 15% of the apps in the app shop, not including thousands of apps built in-house at companies for every line-of-business need. Ionic is unique in that it takes a web-based approach, leveraging HTML, CSS and Javascript to create high quality progressive web, desktop, iOS and Android apps.

### Laravel 8 Apps Webs
A software framework designed to aid developers in building web applications with web services, web resources, and web APIs is a web framework. It provides the developer a standard way to develop and deploy web applications on the internet. The goal of web frameworks is to automate the overhead associated with the usual tasks performed in web development.

The latest Laravel version 8 was released on September 8, 2020. By now, it has become a true MVC web framework. The company is also planning some future releases in the coming years. Riding on a decade of expertise, Laravel is the talk of the town for its high-end features and extensive documentation.
